*Complete CRUD interface showing a data table with book entries including cover images, titles, authors, publishers, and years. Features include search functionality, pagination controls (showing 5 entries per page), and action buttons (view, edit, delete) for each book. Dark-themed interface matching the landing page design.*

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application is a complete serverless bookstore management system that allows users to browse, add, update, and delete books. The entire infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, making it easily deployable and maintainable. The application demonstrates modern cloud architecture patterns including serverless computing, NoSQL databases, API Gateway integration, and static website hosting.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- Python 3.8+ (for local Lambda development)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
